# Diceware ðŸŽ²

##Overview

Diceware is a method for generating passphrases that uses dice rolls to randomly select words from special word lists. Each word in the list is preceded by a digit.
This allows you to use the outcomes of dice rolls to select words from the list.

This scripts seek to programmatically automate this process, while adding a variety of wordlists and password strength testing methods.
